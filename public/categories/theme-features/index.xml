      <description>&amp;ldquo;Just a spoonful of Hugo helps the blog go down.&amp;rdquo;
  me, only somewhat kidding  You can read the previous post about my &amp;ldquo;Spoonful of Hugo&amp;rdquo; series here. In this series, I&amp;rsquo;m sharing small spoonfuls of Hugo that I have learned that hopefully can help you get your site UP (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated).
This is my second post in this series, and it is a relatively quick one.</description>

 me, only somewhat kidding   As a happy blogdown user, a common story I hear from other #rstats users is that you try to change one little thing in Hugo, and the whole site breaks. Here be dragons for folks who aren&amp;rsquo;t web developers.
I&amp;rsquo;m here to tell you that there are small spoonfuls of Hugo that can help you get your site UP (and even better- more efficient, more streamlined, more automated), even if you are not in the least bit interested in transitioning into a career in web development üòè.</description>
