Hello, my name is Ibrahim Saidi. I'm a self-taught programmer (through [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/) and [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com
)). I enjoy working at the intersection of data science and web development. I'm a passionate R user and developer. I build [Shiny Apps](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/) apps, interactive tutorials for R, and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/). 

Browse my [list of Shiny apps](/projects), [blog posts](/post), or review my [full curricullum vitae (resume)](files/cv.pdf).

### Let's do something together!
If you're interested in working with me, please drop me a line at [ibrahim.saidi@unisa.edu.au](#contact). :smiley:
