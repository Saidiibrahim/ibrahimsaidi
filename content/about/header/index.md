<!-- this is a subheadline -->
As an undergrad, I studied at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), where I received a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science. I then went on to pursue a Masters' degree in Biotechnology(biomedical). 

After struggling to find work in my area of study, I decided to learn programming. I was particularly interested in R because I had been introduced to it in during Master's degree. A few months into learning R, i quickly discovered I'm even more interested in building R powered web applications, or Shiny apps.
