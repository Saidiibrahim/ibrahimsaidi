  Hi there! Welcome.

<!-- this is a subheadline -->
As an undergrad, I studied at [The University of Adelaide](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/), where I received a Bachelor's degree in Biomedical Science. I then went on to pursue a Masters' degree in Biotechnology(biomedical). 

After struggling to find work in my area of study, I decided to learn programming. I was particularly interested in R because I had been introduced to it in during Master's degree. A few months into learning R, i quickly discovered I'm even more interested in building R powered web applications, or Shiny apps.

One of the things I'm most passionate about is making self-directed learning of R easier for others. Novice or not, I hope you find my blog posts useful. I'll dedicate this blog to R programming, but you can check out[ my medium blog articles](https://ibrahimsaidi94.medium.com/), where I write about wide ranging topics.

 I hope this site serves as a resource for your own personal learning journey, and is a place where you enjoy spending time and feel a little less alone as you embark on your learning endeavors.
